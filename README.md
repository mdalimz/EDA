##Advantages of Using EDA
Here are a few advantages of using Exploratory Data Analysis - 

Gain Insights Into Underlying Trends and Patterns: EDA assists data analysts in identifying crucial trends quickly through data visualizations using various graphs, such as box plots and histograms. Businesses also expect to make some unexpected discoveries in the data while performing EDA, which can help improve certain existing business strategies.  
Improved Understanding of Variables: Data analysts can significantly improve their comprehension of many factors related to the dataset. Using EDA, they can extract various information such as averages, means, minimum and maximum, and more such information is required for preprocessing the data appropriately. 
Better Preprocess Data to Save Time: EDA can assist data analysts in identifying significant mistakes, abnormalities, or missing values in the existing dataset. Handling the above entities is critical for any organization before beginning a full study as it ensures correct preprocessing of data and may help save a significant amount of time by avoiding mistakes later when applying machine learning models. 
Make Data-driven Decisions: The most significant advantage of employing EDA in an organization is that it helps businesses to improve their understanding of data. With EDA in machine learning, they can use the available tools to extract critical insights and make conclusions, which assist in making decisions based on the insights from the EDA.
